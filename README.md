# Notifear - Android App
Missing the offers among those hundreds of notifications that get pushed to your mobile when you dismiss?

Worry No More. NotifEar is an android application that acts like an ear to your mobile listening to a few selected in-app push notifications.All that you need to do is to set up apps for which you would like to receive notifications for. NotifEar ensures that your push notifications are saved and categorised(latest on top) for you to always get back and look at the offer that you thought you had missed.

Also, we understand that having too much crap makes any system less healthy. NotifEar doesn't keep any notifications that are more than three days old.
